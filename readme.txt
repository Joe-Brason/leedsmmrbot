Hello! Glad you're here :)

This project is very much at its beginning, and likely won't be used much but anyway..

I am making a Discord bot which can use the TRN (rocketleague.tracker.network) API to get peoples MMR in Rocket League.
From there, the bot will then store any data it fetches in its own database (eventually), and will be able to interact
with a user via commands, for example !mmr 3s [@discordName]
will (hopefully) return the ranked 3s information about @discordName or, if that param is left blank, the person who
ran the command. The way the info is displayed is not set in stone yet. If I can get far enough, it'll be in the form
of some sort of generated image, perhaps even showing the user their graph. Otherwise it'll be texted based.

The most useful feature of the bot will be !DSN [@discordName]

This command will (again hopefully) show a players DSN, which is an average of previous season peaks.

Do I think this bot will ever get finished? No clue, but hopefully.

Stay safe
